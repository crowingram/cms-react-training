# Exercise 1: Your First Components

Create a repo in GitHub named “cms-react-training” under your own account. This repo will be used for all the exercises in the coursework as well as the final project at the end. To keep things manageable, each exercise and the final project should each be in their own branch on this repo. For now, you only need to make one (1) branch: the one for this exercise and should be named “exercise-1”.

1) In your new repo, build a **NextJS** app.

2) Build a **Comic** component.

	a. Styling must be done with Next’s built-in CSS Modules system.

	b. Images just be loaded via **Next/Image**.

	c. Must include sub-components for **Button** as well as a **Detail**.

3) Iterate over the array of comics in the **Static Data** and render a **Comic** for each one.

4) Comics should be displayed in a responsive grid.

	a. Use inline styles via the _style_ attribute on the element wrapping the comics. It should only take ~3 lines of CSS to create a rudimentary responsive grid.

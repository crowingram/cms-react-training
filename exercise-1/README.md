## Marvel API Keys required for app to run

This app uses the Marvel API. For it to work, you'll need to acquire your own API key from the Marvel website and store it in a .env file in the root directory in the following format:

NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVATE_API_KEY = [your private key]
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUBLIC_API_KEY = [your public key]
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL = http://gateway.marvel.com

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
